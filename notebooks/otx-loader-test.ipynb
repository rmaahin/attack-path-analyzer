That domain, electronicfrontierfoundation.org, is designed to trick users into a false sense of trust and it appears to have been used in a spear phishing attack, though it is unclear who the intended targets were. The domain was registered on August 4, 2015, under a presumably false name, and we suspect that the attack started on the same day. At the time of this writing the domain is still serving malware.\\n\\nElectronicfrontierfoundation.org was not the only domain involved in this attack. It seems to be part of a larger campaign, known as “Pawn Storm”. The current phase of the Pawn Storm attack campaign started a little over a month ago, and the overall campaign was first identified in an October 2014 report from Trend Micro (PDF). The group behind the attacks is possibly associated with the Russian government and has been active since at least 2007.\",\n",

This same attacker is also reported to have targeted various military installations in Central Asia in the past [1].

By 2010, BlackEnergy 2 had developed rootkit capabilities. In 2014 and 2015, it dropped rootkit capability, and improved modularity with a plug-in framework, reducing its footprint on the network and the victim machines. In 2013, Quedagh variants also gained capabilities to bypass 64-bit Windows&apos; User Access Controls (UAC) and driver signing. The architecture includes plug-ins for network discovery, information theft, remote code execution, credential theft, and data destruction, among others. Variants support both Windows and Linux targets, including ARM/MIPS architectures, as well as some Cisco routers and some SCADA equipment.\\n\\nSeveral BlackEnergy variants are available on the open market in the Russian cyber underground.',\n",

We believe that this attacker operates out of China. In addition to Russia, targeted regions include neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Belarus, and other European countries. The spear-phishing campaigns we detected use links to RAR-compressed executables and Microsoft Word attachments that exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability.\\n\\nThis particular APT is targeting organizations that include weapons manufacturers, human rights activists, and pro-democracy groups, among others.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Sources: TrendMicro, ThreatConnect, CrowdStrike\\n\\n- Based on open sources and CSIA reports, there seems to be a clear forensic trail linking the DNC and related email hacks to the Russian Pawn Storm cyber espionage campaign against Western and United States targets. From social networks, it seems the mainstream media has yet to fully come to grips with the fact that we are probably witnessing a sophisticated PsyOp by the Russians, designed and timed perfectly to tamper with the US electoral process. This pulse may seem redundant, but the purpose of posting it is to highlight the need for ANSIR security measures. There are several gullible political newsgroups who continue to enable Pawn Storm decoys to draw attention.\\n\\nExploits for the following vulnerabilities: CVEs: CVE-2010-3333, CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2013-1347, CVE-2013-3897, CVE-2014-1761, CVE-2014-1776, CVE-2015-2590, CVE-2015-4902, CVE-2015-7645',\n",

It is possible thanks to the modular design of this malware – it consists of the main binary (the one user downloads and infects with), which later downloads several additional modules from the C2 server – they modify code by overwriting some of the called functions with their own. An example of some actions these modules perform is spreading by posting click-bait messages on Facebook and VKontakte (Russian social network).\\n\\n\\nBot communicates with the botmaster using non-standard protocol built on top of TCP. The first message after establishing the connection is always sent by the server – the most important thing it contains is a random 128-byte key used for encrypting further communication. It is therefore impossible to decode the communication if one wasn’t listening right from its beginning.',\n",

Now, cybersecurity researchers at IBM X-Force Research -- who last month spotted malware attacking Brazilian banks ahead of the Olympics -- have observed the launch of a fresh version of Qadars and a new infection campaign. This time, the malware campaign is targeting 18 banks in the UK -- which haven&#39;t been named for security reasons -- as well as financial institutions in Germany, Poland, and once again, the Netherlands.',\n",

Since then, nothing has been heard from those actors but the speculation was that some of programmers and other elements of the criminal operation would be subsumed into other cybercriminal operations.\\n\\nIn September 2016, Fidelis Cybersecurity was alerted to a new malware bot calling itself TrickBot that it is believed to have a strong connection to the Dyre banking trojan. From first glance at the loader, called TrickLoader, there are some striking similarities between it and the loader that Dyre commonly used.

Domain fronting provides outbound network connections that are indistinguishable from legitimate requests for popular websites.\\n\\nAPT29 has used The Onion Router (TOR) and the TOR domain fronting plugin meek to create a hidden, encrypted network tunnel that appeared to connect to Google services over TLS. This tunnel provided the attacker remote access to the host system using the Terminal Services (TS), NetBIOS, and Server Message Block (SMB) services, while appearing to be traffic to legitimate websites.

They then distribute the trojanized application using their own, Russian-language-targeted Android Application sites.\\n\\nSome of the popular Android applications that Ewind targets include GTA Vice City, AVG cleaner, Minecraft – Pocket Edition, Avast!
